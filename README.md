# <Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide webpage was assembled with the aim at educating an audience new to basic computer webpage design. It was created as an introductory learning tool, covering some fundamentals of .html, .css, git and JavaScript. The webpage demystifies the stigma that laypeople may have around web design by breaking concepts into clear and useful study topics. I learned not only some fundamental coding, but a lot about myself as well.
